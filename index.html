           On my website as a freelance web developer, my portfolio includes projects that I have developed over the past six years both in collaboration with web studios and for private clients, as well as several personal projects. Most of these sites were developed using CMS Joomla, CMS WordPress. The bulk of the projects contain individual functions designed to implement the features of the website. In addition to the created sites in the portfolio, I have also developed various calculators, complex feedback forms, a multi-level menu, image sliders, reviews, etc., a lot of CMS updates to the new version with the transfer of all content from the old one while maintaining the functionality of the website, corrections of various errors on sites, optimization of site loading, filling the site to 15,000 products, materials (text information) and much more...

            Creating websites has always been a very serious and painstaking job. In cases when it is needed for a report, "for show", then, of course, it does not make sense to spend a lot of time and decent amounts on it. But if you create such a website to solve significant business problems, you can't treat it somehow, "carelessly" categorically. The Internet, although it is a virtual environment, but the knowledge, effort and time spent on creating such sites are quite real. Many customers have a fairly common misconception that creating a website is easy, simple and fast. It is enough just to click create a website on the free constructor and it will bear fruit... But this is not the case, since free sites are always cut down functionally, not optimized, the design is always boring and primitive, which in turn reflects on the client as someone who does not care about his reputation... The most obvious difference between working with a freelance web developer directly and working with a web studio is that the prices for services are much lower, it's like shopping in the Chinese market or in a supermarket, things are the same, but the price is different for the better for the client! As I think the only disadvantage of ordering a website from a professional freelancer is that there is no possibility of concluding a contract, since freelance web developers rarely do IP or PE, which in turn again affects the cost of creating a website and makes it less... There are a lot of freelancers providing website creation services, but there are only a few professional freelancers and there is a risk of falling into the hands of a bad specialist, which in turn will lead to a loss of time, money and nerves. I will provide you with high-quality professional services of a freelance web developer, and you will get exactly the site you wanted!
